# Stock Price Analysis

By Julia Luo, Zoe Garbus, and Vivian Chen

This is our final project for the Intro to Programming with Data class at Northeastern University. 

It is a python data analysis of the impact of the Ukraine-Russia War on stock prices, specifically of companies that pulled out of the Russian economy. The datasets for each company were collected from public stock market records on Yahoo Finance. We utilized various techniques such as data cleaning, arithmetic operations, and data visualization with Matplotlib to determine which industry was most impacted by this conflict.
